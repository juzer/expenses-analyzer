# Expenses Analyzer
Simple tool for analyzing expenses from my banking account. It takes as an argument a path to a file containing list of transactions and generates two charts, one with all expenses bigger that 50 â‚¬ distributed over time and another one with aggregated expenses/income per month.
This small hobby project was scribbled in Python 2.7.
